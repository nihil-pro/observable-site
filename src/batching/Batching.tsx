      <p>
        Batching is a mechanism that allows to run <em>effect</em> only once, for changes that were made almost at the
        same time.<br/>
        â˜ž <em>Effect</em> is a function which were passed to <a href='#subscribe'>subscribe</a>, <a href='#autorun'>autorun</a> or <a href='#observer'>observer</a>.

            Let's make some preparations before we get into how it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll need:<br/>
            â€“ An observable with three properties: <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em><br/>
            â€“ A listener which will log all changes<br/>
            â€“ A subscriber which should be invoked when <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> or <em>c</em> changes<br/>
            â€“ A delay function which will emulate async requests
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally we'll change the <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> on a change function in different ways.

          <p>Why <em>effect</em> is invoked twice?</p>
          <p>
            Because assignment value to "b" property is deferred by "await" statement to the next tick,
            but changes are considered made at the same time, if they happen in the same tick.
